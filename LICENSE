# LICENSE

I would *love* to license ClassicPad™ as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).  

But here’s the catch: this entire code is **100% AI-generated**.  

So, legally speaking, your guess is as good as mine. The waters here are murky, foggy, and possibly full of sea monsters.  

Feel free to use, modify, or share ClassicPad™ — but keep in mind:  

- If the AI overlords come knocking, I’m just a humble messenger.  
- If you want to be safe, treat this like a wild west code frontier.  
- If you figure out the legal stuff, please let me know!

Basically:  
Use at your own risk. Share with care. Laugh with joy.
