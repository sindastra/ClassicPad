# ClassicPad™  
*An exercise in irony*

---

Remember the good old Notepad.exe? Simple, fast, and not pretending to be your AI overlord? Yeah, that one.  

ClassicPad™ is here to **replace the AI-bloated, Copilot-infested Notepad.exe** with a classic, no-nonsense text editor — just like the original.  

The kicker?  
ClassicPad™ is *entirely written by AI*. Because nothing says "back to basics" like relying on the very technology you’re trying to escape.  

So go ahead, open ClassicPad™ and enjoy the simplicity of yesterday — ironically crafted by tomorrow’s AI.
